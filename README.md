Conclusion
Between January and June, the business experienced remarkable growth, with total revenue increasing by 100%. This impressive performance was driven by the significant contributions from three key branches:

Astoria branch: 33.23% of total revenue
Hells Kitchen branch: 33.84% of total revenue
Lower Manhattan branch: 32.92% of total revenue
The relatively balanced distribution of revenue across these branches highlights the consistent performance and potential of each location. Additionally, a clear sales pattern emerged, with noticeable spikes occurring on the 5th day of every month, indicating either recurring customer behavior or a promotional factor that may warrant further exploration to maximize revenue on other days.

A crucial finding is that coffee products represent more than 55% of total revenue, making it the dominant product category. This suggests that focusing on coffee product offerings, promotions, and customer experience could further drive sales growth in this area.

To sustain this momentum, analyzing the reasons behind the monthly sales spikes and leveraging the strong coffee sales could provide opportunities for strategic adjustments and continued revenue growth
